Letterboxd is a social networking service/app focused on sharing, discovering and reviewing movies. On Letterboxd, you can 'log' movies after you have seen them, adding them to your diary.
The diary serves as a nice way to keep track of movies you have watched chronologically. 

This script, created with Python's <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.html'>http</a> and <a href='https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/'>beautiful soup</a> frameworks, allows the user to web-scrape their letterboxd diary (as long as it's public) and save it to a text file. Just a small tool if anyone ever needs it :)!
Since this is a web-scrapper and websites are always changing, it's not guaranteed that the script will 100% work if the Letterboxd website gets updated or changed. Either way, it works as of 2022 :)!
